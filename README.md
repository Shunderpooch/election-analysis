# Election Analysis

Gathering data from the 2016 election and _actually analyzing_ it is difficult, more so than it needs to be. Going to start with cleaning primary data and curating some core subsets of the data, and ideally expand to analysis and future elections.

Special thanks to the [Bucknell Digital Commons](https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/election_data/1/#attach_additional_files) with their readily available county-level primary dataset!

Feel free to download their data, fork this repo, and get started on your own!
